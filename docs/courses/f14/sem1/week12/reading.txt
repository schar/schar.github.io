# Reading for Nov 18, 21
====================================================
Karttunen (1976): Discourse Referents

Additional reading on dynamic semantics for folks
with some logic background: Gamut: Logic, Language,
and Meaning (vol. 2), Section 7.4 [also includes
a semantics for the closely related DRT system]. NB:
this reading gives the semantics for a regimented
formal language, not any natural language.
