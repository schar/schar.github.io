For Oct 5 & 7:

1. Review H&K Chapter 2, making sure you're comfortable
   with the formal apparatus and the way to construct
   interpretations for syntactically complex objects.

2. Read H&K Chapter 4. 

3. We won't focus on Chapter 3 in this class, but those of 
   you with interests in syntax may wish to read it.
