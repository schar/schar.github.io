For Oct 12 & 14:

In preparation for learning about variable binding in natural
language, we'll first learn about the syntax and semantics of
the predicate calculus. Then we'll use what we've gleaned to 
build a semantics for the lambda calculus. 

1. Allwood et al., Chapter 5

2. If you're thirsty for more on predicate logic, have a look 
   at Gamut, Volume 1, Chapter 3 (also in the course readings
   folder.)
