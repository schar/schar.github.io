For September 8 & 9, please read (in decreasing
order of importance):

=====================================================

1. Heim & Kratzer: Chapter 1 (12pp)

2. Grice: Logic and Conversation (18pp)
    
3. Stalnaker: Pragmatic Presuppositions (12pp)

4. Start having a look through Allwood et al., if you 
   have some extra time.

=====================================================

Readings are uploaded as pdfs in the /pdfs/ directory 
where they're listed alphabetically by author. I've 
included the reading for next week, along with a few 
other textbooks that you might find useful (these are 
*not* required reading!). 

Here is some more info on the textbooks:

1. Allwood et al: we'll be working through this next
    week. Good, reasonably leisurely intro to the 
    formal concepts we'll be relying on. 

2. Carpenter: a useful reference for folks who are
    interested in categorial grammar and alternative
    approaches to the syntax-semantics interface.

3. Dowty et al: a book-length exegesis of Montague's
    PTQ (where it all began).
    
4. Gamut: an fine introduction to semantics, geared
    more towards logicians. Distinctly Dutch.

5. Partee et al: a classic "introductory" text, much
    heavier on formalism than what we'll be doing. 
    
6. Sider: much more on formal logic, geared towards 
    philosophers. 

The folder named /ZZZZ/ has a bunch of other pdfs.
Feel free to browse.
