Notes on the reading: definitely review H&K 2.5 before 
tackling the Gordon. The Gordon reading is more formal, 
with more symbols, but don't let that intimidate you:
you have the necessary background to understand 
everything discussed in this chapter. Think of Gordon as
defining a formal language and then telling you how to 
establish equivalences between expressions in the formal
language --- rather like what we saw in class for 
propositional logic (though Gordon does not give a 
semantics for the lambda calculus -- we'll see that in
a few weeks time).

Gordon uses one bit of notation that you might find new. 
It's called BNF, and it's used in the exact same way as 
phrase-structure rules are used in syntax. For example,
a syntactician would write the following to indicate that
a VP can either consist of a V followed by a DP, or a V 
followed by a DP and a PP:

   VP -> V DP
   VP -> V DP PP

The way you write this in BNF is as follows:

   VP ::= V DP | V DP PP
   
Simple!
