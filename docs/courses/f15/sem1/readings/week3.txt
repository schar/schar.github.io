For September 14 & 16, please read (in decreasing
order of importance):

========================================================

1. Review Heim & Kratzer -- Section 1.3 [8pp]

2. Allwood et al. -- Chs. 2 & 4 [~40pp] (Ch. 4 refers 
   to the notion of a 'possible world'. See Sections 3.4
   & 3.5 for a bit of background on that.)

3. Heim & Kratzer -- Ch. 2 [~29pp] (Most of this won't
   be relevant until Week 4, but start having a look
   anyway, if your schedule permits.)
