  title: Scalar implicature and exceptional scope
  abstract: |
    There is lots of work on scalar implicature, lots of work on the
    exceptional scope properties of indefinites, and comparatively little work
    on the scalar implicatures of exceptionally scoping indefinites. This note
    points out that a phenomenon of 'exceptional scalar distributivity'
    suggests that the scalar alternatives of indefinites are more abstract
    than we might have figured: they don't correspond to any actually
    expressible lexemes, and they aren't, strictly speaking, alternatives of
    the indefinite determiner at all! I develop a rudimentary account,
    pointing out various issues, predictions, and choice points along the way.
    I show that two different kinds of theories can be used to explain the
    data: one uses choice functions for exceptional scope, and another uses
    alternatives directly.

  title: Where is the destructive update problem?
  abstract: |
    Though much research assumes or argues that there’s a ‘destructive update’
    problem for dynamic accounts of anaphora, it isn’t easy to see what this
    problem is supposed to consist in. There do not, in particular, seem to be
    any problematic empirical predictions associated with destructive update.
    In a sense, this is unsurprising: destructive update of assignments is a
    characteristic feature of how binding is perpetrated in static systems
    (including first-order logic and the λ-calculus). The difference between
    static and dynamic systems isn’t that only dynamic systems allow
    destructive update — it’s that only dynamic systems treat assignment
    functions as bona fide semantic values, as information.

  title: Givenness, compositionally and dynamically
  abstract: |
    Schwarzschild's Givenness constraint is at odds with compositionality:
    whether an expression satisfies it can’t, in general, be known on the
    basis of the expression's meaning and the meanings of its siblings alone.
    Fortunately, Rooth defines a compositional focus interpretation operator
    which can be repurposed to do the job. I argue that the anaphoric
    character of this Givenness operator must be taken seriously: Givenness
    operators can be bound in all the same ways as pronouns --- that is,
    there's evidence they participate in both in-scope and donkey-anaphoric
    binding. I sketch a dynamic theory of Givenness operators that secures
    these results.

  title: On the semantics of exceptional scope
  abstract: |
    I motivate a new theory of exceptional scope phenomena in natural
    language—that is, the ability of some expressions to affect the
    interpretation of others from inside scope islands. I propose that a scope
    island is any domain that is obligatorily evaluated and that exceptional
    scope uniformly reflects linguistic side effects taking scope after the
    evaluation of a scope island.

    Stochastic time analysis of syllable-referential intervals and simplex
    onsets
  abstract: |
    We pursue an analysis of the relation between qualitative syllable parses
    and their quantitative phonetic consequences. To do this, we express the
    statistics of a symbolic organization corresponding to a syllable parse in
    terms of continuous phonetic parameters which quantify the timing of the
    consonants and vowels that make up syllables: consonantal plateau
    durations, vowel durations, and their variances. These parameters can be
    estimated from continuous phonetic data. This enables analysis of the link
    between symbolic phonological form and the continuous phonetics in which
    this form is manifest. Pursuing such an analysis, we illustrate the
    predictions of the syllabic organization corresponding to simplex onsets
    and derive a number of previously experimentally observed and simulation
    results. Specifically, we derive not only the canonical phonetic
    manifestations of simplex onsets but also the result that, under certain
    conditions we make precise, the phonetic indices of the simplex onset
    organization change to a range of values characteristic of the complex
    onset organization. Finally, we explore the behavior of phonetic indices
    for syllabic organization over progressively increasing sizes of lexical
    samples, thereby concomitantly diversifying the phonetic context over
    which these indices are taken.

  title: Bound ‘de re’ pronouns and the LFs of attitude reports
  abstract: |
    An empirical argument is given in support of Percus & Sauerland’s (2003)
    theory of ‘de re’ ascription, according to which the internal argument of
    *believe* is a function from concept-generators to propositions. The
    argument concerns pronouns in the scope of attitude verbs that are
    interpreted both ‘de re’ and as bound variables. It is argued that more
    traditional theories of ‘de re’ ascription—specifically, theories that
    take the ‘res’ to be an internal argument of *believe*—fail to account for
    such pronouns, as they predict that a pronoun cannot simultaneously be an
    argument of *believe* and bound by a quantifier in the scope of *believe*.

  title: Cross-categorial donkeys

    Data from surprising sloppy readings of verb phrase ellipsis constructions
    argue that ellipsis sites can partially or totally consist of dynamically
    bound pro-forms. I give an account, integrating Muskens’ CDRT with a
    focus-based theory of ellipsis and deaccenting.

  title: Can DP be a scope island?
  abstract: |
    Sauerland (2005) uses data from inverse linking to motivate quantifier
    raising (QR) out of DP, proposing to derive Larson’s generalization
    regarding the scopal integrity of DP via an Economy-based constraint on
    QR. I first lay out Sauerland’s three arguments for QR out of DP. I
    present (a slightly modified version of) his mechanism for constraining
    QR. I show that it both over- and under- generates. I conclude by arguing
    that the readings Sauerland uses to motivate his account don’t result from
    an island-respecting QR mechanism.

  title: \"Strong\" predicative presuppositional objects
  abstract: |
    I argue for a less subtle picture of presupposition projection out of
    quantified contexts in order to account for the projective behavior of
    “strong” predicative presuppositions. Specifically, strong predicative
    presuppositions seem to give rise to robust universal inferences whether
    embedded in a quantified (subject) DP’s restrictor or nuclear scope.

  title: "Free and bound pro-verbs: a unified treatment of anaphora"
  abstract: |
    This paper argues that certain phenomena related to verb (phase) ellipsis
    in English suggest a degree of interpretive flexibility for ellipsis sites
    close to that exhibited by pronominals. Specifically, it is claimed that (a)
    like pronouns, ellipsis sites may be bound or free, and (b) one set of
    grammatical mechanisms affords analyses of both free and bound pronominals
    and free and bound pro-verbs.
