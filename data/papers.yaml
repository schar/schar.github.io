  title: A modular theory of pronouns and binding
  location: Submitted to <em>Proceedings of LENLS 14</em>
  abstract: |
    Since Shan's (2002) pioneering work, a number of researchers have argued
    that <em>monads</em> offer a flexible, robust compositional interface for
    expressions that denote in "enriched spaces". This paper argues that a
    monadic treatment of pronouns and assignment-sensitivity has a number of
    theoretical and empirical benefits, including (i) a maximally simple
    lexicon and a fully categorematic treatment of abstraction; (ii)
    centrally, immediate analyses of paycheck pronouns and binding
    reconstruction, with a unitary, simple semantics for pronouns and traces.
    The treatment involves abstracting out the two functions that underlie
    standard treatments of assignment-friendly composition --- yielding a
    so-called <em>applicative functor</em> --- and then adding a third
    function to deal with 'higher-order' variables, yielding a monad. Two
    developments of the basic idea are briefly explored. First, I argue that a
    mere applicative functor turns out to be sufficient after all, if we (a)
    adopt a more type-theoretically conservative treatment of assignments than
    is standard, and (b) countenance sentence meanings that depend on multiple
    assignments. Second, I demonstrate an equivalence of the resulting theory
    with a <em>variable-free semantics</em>, one which extends both to the
    combinatory apparatus underwriting composition, and to the resulting
    semantic values.

  title: Parsing with Dynamic Continuized CCG
  location: |
    <em>Proceedings TAG+13</em>, Association for Computational Linguistics,
    71--83
  abstract: |
    We present an implemented method of parsing with Combinatory Categorial
    Grammar (CCG) that for the first time derives the exceptional scope
    behavior of indefinites in a principled and plausibly practical way. The
    account implements Charlow's (2014) monadic approach to dynamic semantics,
    in which indefinites' exceptional scope taking follows from the way the
    side effect of introducing a discourse referent survives the process of
    delimiting the scope of true quantifiers in a continuized grammar. To
    efficiently parse with this system, we extend Barker and Shan's (2014)
    method of parsing with continuized grammars to only invoke monadic lifting
    and lowering where necessary, and define novel normal form constraints
    on lifting and lowering to avoid spurious ambiguities. We also integrate
    Steedman's (2000) CCG for deriving basic predicate-argument structure and
    enrich it with a method of lexicalizing scope island constraints. We argue
    that the resulting system improves upon Steedman's CCG in terms of
    theoretical perspicuity and empirical coverage while retaining many of its
    attractive computational properties.

  title: "The scope of alternatives: Indefiniteness and islands"
  location: Accepted at <em>Linguistics & Philosophy</em>
  abstract: |
    I argue that expressions that denote sets of alternatives interact with
    their semantic contexts by taking scope. My account relies only on two
    freely-applying type-shifters: the first is Karttunen's (1977)
    proto-question operator, aka Partee's (1986) IDENT, and the second can be
    factored out of extant approaches to the semantics of questions in the
    tradition of Karttunen (1977). These type-shifters form a decomposition
    of LIFT, the familiar function mapping values into scope-takers.
    Exceptional scope of alternative-generating expressions arises via
    (snowballing) scopal pied-piping. With an empirical focus on English
    indefinites, I argue that this approach to alternatives improves on
    standard alternative-semantic architectures that use point-wise
    composition to subvert islands (and, more generally, on in situ approaches
    to indefinites). Specifically, unlike grammars based on point-wise
    composition, scope-based alternative management is thoroughly
    categorematic, does not under-generate readings when multiple indefinites
    occur on an island, and is readily compatible with standard treatments of
    binding. I explore two generalizations of the basic theory: one is
    oriented around assignment-relative sets of alternatives, and the other
    incorporates a dynamic perspective on assignment functions. The upshot is
    that dynamic semantics can be seen as a strict extension of alternative
    semantics, with the initial results (including island insensitivity for
    alternative generators) preserved.

  title: Post-suppositions and semantic theory
  location: Accepted pending minor revisions at <em>Journal of Semantics</em>
  abstract: |
    I explore two alternatives to post-suppositions for generating cumulative
    readings of sentences with multiple modified numerals. The first uses
    higher-order dynamic generalized quantifiers (GQs), functions whose
    ‘trace' is itself a dynamic GQ. Such functions, though a hop-and-a-skip up
    the type hierarchy from dynamic GQs, are already available to any
    standard-issue Montagovian dynamic semanticist, and dealing with them
    compositionally requires nothing beyond whatever machinery already
    under-writes quantifiers in object position, scope ambiguity, and so on. I
    build on this theory by exploring a type-theoretic elaboration of it
    (technically, in terms of subtype polymorphism) that rules out arguably
    unattested ‘pseudo-cumulative' readings. Second, I show that even these
    steps (higher-order dynamic GQs, subtyping) are unnecessary if the usual
    ‘point-wise' dynamic semantics of Dynamic Predicate Logic or Compositional
    DRT, where propositions are relations on assignments, is replaced with an
    update semantics, where propositions are functions from sets of
    assignments into sets of assignments. Conservative update-semantic
    meanings for modified numerals --- direct update-theoretic analogs of
    their point-wise counterparts --- automatically yield cumulative readings
    and fail to derive pseudo-cumulative readings. This gives an argument for
    an update semantics in the anaphoric domain, so far as I know the first of
    its kind. I compare these two analyses with each other and consider
    their relation to post-suppositions in semantic theory more generally,
    concluding: (i) the theories canvassed here have conceptual and empirical
    advantages over post-suppositions; (ii) the update-theoretic account
    offers the most direct route to an empirically adequate analysis of
    modified numerals; (iii) the reasons for this turn out to be specific to
    modified numerals; other post-suppositional analyses are better
    reformulated with higher-order GQs.

  title: "Debugging choice functions"
  location: Manuscript coming soon
  abstract: |
    Choice functions are commonly used to give accounts of exceptionally
    scoping indefinites. However, choice functions also allow restricted
    indefinites to acquire a kind of “scope” over any operators that bind
    pronouns in their restrictors. As Schwarz (2001) points out, this leads
    to systematic over-generation when the operators in question are not
    upward monotone. I point out that versions of this problem arise for a
    wide variety of constructions --- including when the operator in question
    is upward monotone, in various kinds of nested indefinite structures, and
    in association with focus --- and afflict various other in situ approaches
    to exceptional scope phenomena --- e.g., the singleton subset selection
    functions of von Fintel (1999, 2000). I propose a general solution,
    inspired by Reinhart's (1997) "intensional choice functions", which relies
    on a relatively extensional treatment of assignment sensitivity and
    variable binding.

  title: Scalar implicature and exceptional scope
  abstract: |
    There is lots of work on scalar implicature, lots of work on the
    exceptional scope properties of indefinites, and comparatively little work
    on the scalar implicatures of exceptionally scoping indefinites. This note
    points out that a phenomenon of 'exceptional scalar distributivity'
    suggests that the scalar alternatives of indefinites are more abstract
    than we might have figured: they don't correspond to any actually
    expressible lexemes, and they aren't, strictly speaking, alternatives of
    the indefinite determiner at all! I develop a rudimentary account,
    pointing out various issues, predictions, and choice points along the way.
    I show that two different kinds of theories can be used to explain the
    data: one uses choice functions for exceptional scope, and another uses
    alternatives directly.

  title: Where is the destructive update problem?
  abstract: |
    Though much research assumes or argues that there's a ‘destructive update'
    problem for dynamic accounts of anaphora, it isn't easy to see what this
    problem is supposed to consist in. There do not, in particular, seem to be
    any problematic empirical predictions associated with destructive update.
    In a sense, this is unsurprising: destructive update of assignments is a
    characteristic feature of how binding is perpetrated in static systems
    (including first-order logic and the λ-calculus). The difference between
    static and dynamic systems isn't that only dynamic systems allow
    destructive update — it's that only dynamic systems treat assignment
    functions as bona fide semantic values, as information.

  title: Givenness, compositionally and dynamically
  abstract: |
    Schwarzschild's Givenness constraint is at odds with compositionality:
    whether an expression satisfies it can't, in general, be known on the
    basis of the expression's meaning and the meanings of its siblings alone.
    Fortunately, Rooth defines a compositional focus interpretation operator
    which can be repurposed to do the job. I argue that the anaphoric
    character of this Givenness operator must be taken seriously: Givenness
    operators can be bound in all the same ways as pronouns --- that is,
    there's evidence they participate in both in-scope and donkey-anaphoric
    binding. I sketch a dynamic theory of Givenness operators that secures
    these results.

  title: On the semantics of exceptional scope
  abstract: |
    I motivate a new theory of exceptional scope phenomena in natural
    language—that is, the ability of some expressions to affect the
    interpretation of others from inside scope islands. I propose that a scope
    island is any domain that is obligatorily evaluated and that exceptional
    scope uniformly reflects linguistic side effects taking scope after the
    evaluation of a scope island.

    Stochastic time analysis of syllable-referential intervals and simplex
    onsets
  abstract: |
    We pursue an analysis of the relation between qualitative syllable parses
    and their quantitative phonetic consequences. To do this, we express the
    statistics of a symbolic organization corresponding to a syllable parse in
    terms of continuous phonetic parameters which quantify the timing of the
    consonants and vowels that make up syllables: consonantal plateau
    durations, vowel durations, and their variances. These parameters can be
    estimated from continuous phonetic data. This enables analysis of the link
    between symbolic phonological form and the continuous phonetics in which
    this form is manifest. Pursuing such an analysis, we illustrate the
    predictions of the syllabic organization corresponding to simplex onsets
    and derive a number of previously experimentally observed and simulation
    results. Specifically, we derive not only the canonical phonetic
    manifestations of simplex onsets but also the result that, under certain
    conditions we make precise, the phonetic indices of the simplex onset
    organization change to a range of values characteristic of the complex
    onset organization. Finally, we explore the behavior of phonetic indices
    for syllabic organization over progressively increasing sizes of lexical
    samples, thereby concomitantly diversifying the phonetic context over
    which these indices are taken.

  title: Bound ‘de re' pronouns and the LFs of attitude reports
  abstract: |
    An empirical argument is given in support of Percus & Sauerland's (2003)
    theory of ‘de re' ascription, according to which the internal argument of
    *believe* is a function from concept-generators to propositions. The
    argument concerns pronouns in the scope of attitude verbs that are
    interpreted both ‘de re' and as bound variables. It is argued that more
    traditional theories of ‘de re' ascription—specifically, theories that
    take the ‘res' to be an internal argument of *believe*—fail to account for
    such pronouns, as they predict that a pronoun cannot simultaneously be an
    argument of *believe* and bound by a quantifier in the scope of *believe*.

  title: Can DP be a scope island?
  abstract: |
    Sauerland (2005) uses data from inverse linking to motivate quantifier
    raising (QR) out of DP, proposing to derive Larson's generalization
    regarding the scopal integrity of DP via an Economy-based constraint on
    QR. I first lay out Sauerland's three arguments for QR out of DP. I
    present (a slightly modified version of) his mechanism for constraining
    QR. I show that it both over- and under- generates. I conclude by arguing
    that the readings Sauerland uses to motivate his account don't result from
    an island-respecting QR mechanism.
